/**
 * Authorise 3D Secure payment (Java Library)
 *
 * 3D Secure (Verifed by VISA / MasterCard SecureCode) is an additional authentication
 * protocol that involves the shopper being redirected to their card issuer where their
 * identity is authenticated prior to the payment proceeding to an authorisation request.
 *
 * In order to start processing 3D Secure transactions, the following changes are required:
 * 1. Your Merchant Account needs to be confgured by Adyen to support 3D Secure. If you would
 *    like to have 3D Secure enabled, please submit a request to the Adyen Support Team (support@adyen.com).
 * 2. Your integration should support redirecting the shopper to the card issuer and submitting
 *    a second API call to complete the payment.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the second API call to complete the payment using Java Library.
 * See the API Manual for a full explanation of the steps required to process 3D Secure payments.
 *
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice user:
 * Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
